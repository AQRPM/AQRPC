# AQRPC
A Quite Rude Password Checker

**You're so damn ignorant, it's fantastic.**
This is AQRPC. We both know you're an inconciderate little prick, and you don't know how to choose a half-decent password.
Get AQRPC, A Quite Rude Password Checker, it might help your tiny brain understand what a good password is.

Why the fuck are password checkers so fucking polite?  
"Dear user, please consider using a tad more symbols if convenient. It would really mean a lot to your security."  
Like fucking really, if you're not using symbols, what's your problem motherfucker?  
Here's what I would do: I would fucking beat you up purely with words.
I'd make you fear the day you chose a bad motherfucking password.

So let's fucking do it. Here's an example:
```
$ ./AQRPC.rb
Ugh, another idiot. Hello. I'm AQRPC. Who are you? Blah blah blah et.c.
I honestly couldn't care less of who you are. Now enter your fucking password.
Password: StarW4rzFan@12345

So, congratz. You just put 2 words togher (star, fan) and boom,
there's your password. Well, lemme tell you what. DICTIONARY ATTACKS, bitch. Ever heard of it?
Let me spell it fucking out for you. D-I-C-T-I-O-N-A-R-Y attacks. I can imagine you bragging to your friends
how good your password is, because you're such a D-I-C-K. One of those 'hackers' you worry to little about
can just loop through words and put them together and boom they got your password.
Notice how fast it was to detect this your password is so bad? I had to loop through the entire list of English words,
make it lowercase, and match with your password. Did you notice how slow it was? No? Exactly.
It's a matter of minutes before somebody cracks your password. Do you still think you're a genius?

You literally have only 1 fucking symbol.
If somebody tries to brute force you, they will probably get away with the most basic dictionary.
And since you're so stupid you probably don't know what I mean by dictionary: I mean the amount of characters it has to try.
The less passwords it has to try, the faster. You'll lose your fucking account in no time.
But then again, if this is the best you can come up with, perhaps you deserve it.

Fantastic bloody work, pal. Just kidding, I'm not your pal. I'm quite happy I don't know you.
I love how you just stand there. COME ON! Can't you see what's going on? YOUR PASSWORD!
IT'S HAS A PATTERN. You're so damn ignorant, it's fantastic. It might not even take a robot to crack this.
No, a human can do patterns just fine. Who's outsmarted now? Do you really think you're the only human in the world
who can add and subtract things?
That's all.
Seriously, that's all. I'm not going to insult you until you're done.
I'm waiting...
Change your passwords. Because I doubt somebody as stupid as you use a password manager. Go change your bloody passwords.
DO IT.

In total, you idiot made it up to 3 fucking points.

By the way, since you were so kind to put an `insult` application in your $PATH, I'll just call that.
Oh! Apparently, a frightened schoolboy is full of eels

## What operating systems does this support?

Anything [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) supports

## Why the fuck would I choose Ruby?

#### Long answer

What are the fucking alternatives? Let's see:  
Compiled: Rust, Go, C  
Interpreted/JIT: Python, Lua, Haskell  

The first motherfucking programming/scripting language I learned was Python.  
And I fucking hate nostalgia. Plus, I don't remember a fucking shit.

I don't think this task suits a powerful functional fucking language,
so goodbye Haskell.

Lua is pointless compared to Ruby. **Plus their damned arrays start at 1**. Instant deal-breaker.  
Go is pointless and slow compared to Rust.  
C is too dangerous and also way too hecking over-kill and ugly for this supposedly simple task.

That leaves us with Rust.  
Rust is the fucking best, but it's also over-kill for this freaking task.  
Plus, Ruby looks a lot like Rust in syntax.
```Ruby
for i in 0...10
    // This is Ruby.
end
```
```Rust
for i in 0..10 {
    // This is Rust.
}
```

#### Honest answer

Because I'm a too lazy piece of shit to make this son of a bitch in a compiled programming language.
